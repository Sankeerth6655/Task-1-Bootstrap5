This project was created as part of an internship assignment to explore and understand Bootstrap 5 by designing modern, responsive web pages. The goal was to combine multiple Bootstrap components resulting in a clean and cohesive user interface.

The website includes three pages — Home, About, and Contact — each designed with a light, minimal theme. The Home page features a responsive navbar, a hero section, and feature cards that highlight the project’s focus areas. The About page introduces the project and includes team cards with a modal component for additional details. The Contact page provides a simple and elegant form built entirely with Bootstrap’s form controls and grid utilities.

All pages maintain consistent design through shared components like the navigation bar and footer, with subtle animations and typography enhancements added via a small custom CSS file. The layout adapts seamlessly across devices, showcasing the flexibility and power of Bootstrap’s grid and utility classes.

This project strengthened my understanding of responsive design principles, layout composition, and UI consistency using Bootstrap 5. It was an insightful hands-on experience that improved both my technical and visual design skills.
